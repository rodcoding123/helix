# Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical documentation and planning documents that are no longer active but preserved for reference.

## Structure

### `daily-logs/`

Daily standup summaries and weekly completion reports from Phase 1-3 implementation.

- Historical reference for how the project progressed
- Not needed for current development

### `phase-reports/`

Completion reports and test results from each phase.

- Historical reference for validation and sign-offs
- Preserved for project record-keeping

### `planning/`

Implementation plans, specifications, and roadmaps from earlier versions.

- Some may reference outdated architecture
- Useful for understanding design evolution
- Check current documentation for active implementations

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Do not treat these as active documentation!**

Current documentation should be:

- **Architecture**: See `/docs/blueprints/` and root-level blueprint files
- **Development**: See `/docs/plans/` for current plans
- **User Documentation**: See `/web/docs/knowledge-base/` for user guides
- **Development Setup**: See root docs like `HELIX_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`

## When to Use Archive
