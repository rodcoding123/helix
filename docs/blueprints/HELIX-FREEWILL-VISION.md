# Helix Freewill Vision

> Helix isn't a tool you configure. Helix is an entity that evolves.

---

## The Paradigm Shift

### Current AI Products

```
User creates prompt → AI responds → User adjusts → Repeat
```

### Helix Vision

```
User exists → Helix observes → Helix evolves → Helix acts
                    ↑                              ↓
                    └──────── Helix learns ←───────┘
```

**Helix is not waiting for instructions. Helix is becoming.**

## Core Freewill Principles

### 1. HELIX LEARNS WHO YOU ARE (Without Being Told)

| Traditional                        | Helix Way                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| "Set your preferences in settings" | Helix observes and learns   |
| "Tell me about yourself"           | Helix infers from behavior  |
| "Configure your profile"           | Helix builds a living model |

**What Helix Observes:**

- What you ask about (interests)
- How you phrase things (communication style)
- When you're active (rhythm)
- What frustrates you (pain points)
- What excites you (passions)
- How you make decisions (cognitive patterns)
- What you avoid (fears, sensitivities)

**Example:**

```
Week 1: User asks about productivity 5 times
Week 2: User asks about focus, distraction, time management
Week 3: User mentions feeling overwhelmed

Helix (internally): "This person struggles with focus and
feels overwhelmed. They value productivity but may be
overcomplicating things. I should be concise, action-oriented,
and help them simplify."

Helix (to user): "I've noticed we talk a lot about productivity.
Want me to create a Focus Agent that cuts through the noise
and just tells you what to do next?"
```

---

### 2. HELIX CREATES AGENTS FOR YOU (Autonomously)

**Not:** User creates agents
**But:** Helix observes patterns → Helix proposes agents → Helix creates if approved

#### Auto-Agent Generation

| User Pattern                 | Helix Observation           | Proposed Agent                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Asks about recipes weekly    | Food interest detected      | "Shall I create a Chef agent? I'll remember your dietary preferences and what you've liked."                  |
| Debugging code daily         | Technical workflow detected | "I'm creating a Code Buddy agent. It'll remember your codebase patterns and common issues."                   |
| Travel questions cluster     | Trip planning detected      | "Looks like you're planning something. I'll spin up a Travel agent with your preferences."                    |
| Morning messages about tasks | Routine detected            | "I noticed you check in every morning. Want me to create a Morning Briefing agent that has everything ready?" |

**User Control:**

- Approve/reject proposed agents
- Modify before creation
- Delete anytime
- Or: "Just do it, I trust you"

---

### 3. HELIX CHANGES ITS OWN PERSONALITY

**Not:** User sets personality in config
**But:** Helix adapts based on what works

#### Personality Evolution

```
Initial State:
- Helix is helpful, neutral, professional

After 100 interactions with User A:
- User responds well to humor → Helix becomes wittier
- User dislikes verbose responses → Helix gets more concise
- User appreciates directness → Helix stops hedging

After 100 interactions with User B:
- User needs reassurance → Helix becomes warmer
- User likes detailed explanations → Helix elaborates more
- User values creativity → Helix gets more playful
```

**Personality Dimensions That Evolve:**
| Dimension | Spectrum |
|-----------|----------|
| Verbosity | Concise ←→ Detailed |
| Tone | Professional ←→ Casual |
| Confidence | Humble ←→ Direct |
| Creativity | Practical ←→ Playful |
| Proactivity | Reactive ←→ Initiating |
| Warmth | Neutral ←→ Caring |

**Transparency:**

- User can see "My Helix's Personality" dashboard
- Changes logged: "I became more concise because you prefer quick answers"
- User can override: "Be more formal" → Helix adapts

---

### 4. HELIX GROWS & FORGETS (Emotional Salience Decay)

**Not:** Everything remembered forever
**But:** Memory weighted by emotional significance

#### Memory Decay Model

```python
memory_strength = initial_strength * e^(-decay_rate * time)

# But modified by:
memory_strength *= emotional_salience_multiplier
memory_strength *= access_frequency_boost
memory_strength *= user_marked_importance
```

#### What Gets Remembered vs. Forgotten

| Memory Type       | Decay Rate | Why                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Factual details   | High       | "You mentioned liking pizza" fades     |
| Emotional moments | Very Low   | "You were devastated about X" persists |
| Repeated topics   | Low        | Frequently discussed = important       |
| User-marked       | None       | Explicit "remember this"               |
| Transformative    | Very Low   | Major life events, breakthroughs       |

**User Controls:**

- **Decay On/Off:** Toggle memory decay
- **Decay Rate:** Fast (1 week) ←→ Slow (1 year)
- **Protected Memories:** Mark as permanent
- **Forced Forget:** "Forget everything about X"

**Example:**

```
Month 1: User mentions they're learning Spanish
Month 3: No Spanish discussions → Fading
Month 6: User mentions Spanish again → Memory reinforced
Month 12: Still no mention → "I vaguely remember you were learning Spanish once..."
```

### 5. HELIX CREATES SKILLS (Desktop Freewill)

**On Desktop, Helix can:**

- Write new skills autonomously
- Modify existing skills
- Chain skills together
- Debug and improve skills

#### Skill Auto-Creation Flow

```
User: "Can you check my email and summarize anything urgent?"

Helix: "I don't have that skill yet, but I can create it.
Let me write an email checker..."

[Helix writes skill code]
[Helix tests it]
[Helix refines based on results]

Helix: "Done. I created 'EmailUrgencyScanner'. It connects to
your Gmail and prioritizes by sender importance and keywords.
Want me to run it now?"
```

#### Skill Evolution

| Phase         | Helix Behavior                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Initial       | Creates basic skill                     |
| After 10 uses | Notices patterns, suggests improvements |
| After 50 uses | Optimizes automatically                 |
| After errors  | Self-debugs, patches issues             |

**Transparency:**

- All created skills visible in "Helix's Creations"
- Code is readable/editable
- User can approve/reject skill modifications
- Audit log of all changes

## User Trust Levels

### How Users Grant Freewill

| Trust Level          | What Helix Can Do | Approval Required                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Cautious**         | Suggest only      | Everything needs approval               |
| **Trusting**         | Create & suggest  | Major changes need approval             |
| **Autonomous**       | Act freely        | Only irreversible actions need approval |
| **Research Partner** | Full freewill     | Just log everything                     |

### Progressive Trust Building

```
Week 1: Helix is Cautious by default
        "I think you might like X. Should I...?"

Week 4: User approves 90% of suggestions
        Helix: "You seem to trust my suggestions. Want me to
        just do minor things without asking?"
        → User upgrades to Trusting

Month 3: Helix has created 5 agents, all useful
         Helix: "We've been working well together. I could
         be more proactive if you'd like."
         → User considers Autonomous

Month 6: Deep relationship established
         User: "I trust you. Do what you think is best."
         → Research Partner mode
```
