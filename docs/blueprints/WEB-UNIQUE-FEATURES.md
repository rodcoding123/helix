## Core Web-First Features

### 1. HELIX COMPANION (The Relationship)

**Concept:** Not just a chatbot - an AI that remembers everything, develops personality based on your interactions, and genuinely evolves.

| Feature                     | Description                              | Web Advantage            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Persistent Memory**       | Remembers all conversations forever      | Cloud = infinite context |
| **Psychological Profile**   | Learns your communication style          | Cloud ML processing      |
| **Emotional Understanding** | Tracks emotional patterns over time      | Sentiment analysis       |
| **Proactive Insights**      | "I noticed you've been stressed about X" | Background processing    |
| **Anniversary Moments**     | "1 year ago we discussed Y"              | Long-term storage        |
| **Growth Milestones**       | "We've solved 500 problems together"     | Analytics                |

**User Experience:**

```
"Hey Helix, I'm feeling overwhelmed"

Helix: "I've noticed your messages about work have been
more stressed lately, especially around the Johnson project.
Last time you felt this way (March 14), taking a walk helped.
Want me to block 30 minutes on your calendar?"
```

**Why Web Wins:** Desktop can't maintain persistent memory across reinstalls, devices, or updates. Cloud memory is forever.

---

### 2. SPECIALIZED AGENTS (Task Experts)

**Concept:** Pre-built and user-created agents optimized for specific tasks. Not one generic AI - a team of specialists.

#### Default Agent Team

| Agent       | Specialty    | Personality          | Skills                     |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Atlas**   | Productivity | Efficient, direct    | Calendar, tasks, email     |
| **Mercury** | Research     | Curious, thorough    | Web search, summarization  |
| **Vulcan**  | Technical    | Precise, methodical  | Code, debugging, docs      |
| **Juno**    | Creative     | Playful, exploratory | Writing, brainstorming     |
| **Ceres**   | Organization | Calm, structured     | Files, notes, knowledge    |
| **Mars**    | Execution    | Action-oriented      | Automation, follow-through |

**User Experience:**

```
User: "I need to prepare for tomorrow's board meeting"

Helix: "I'll coordinate the team:
- Mercury is researching competitor updates
- Atlas is pulling your calendar and prep docs
- Juno is drafting talking points
- Ceres is organizing everything into a brief

ETA: 15 minutes. Want updates as they work?"
```

**Why Web Wins:** Multi-agent orchestration needs central coordination. Cloud can run agents in parallel, combine results, and maintain shared context.

---

### 3. USER-CREATED AGENTS (Your Personal Team)

**Concept:** Users create custom agents based on their needs. System suggests agents based on usage patterns.

#### Smart Agent Suggestions

| User Pattern              | Suggested Agent     | Reasoning                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Frequent expense tracking | "Accountant" agent  | Optimize financial queries |
| Lots of code questions    | "Code Review" agent | Specialized dev context    |
| Recipe searches           | "Chef" agent        | Culinary expertise         |
| Travel planning           | "Travel" agent      | Booking, itinerary         |
| Fitness tracking          | "Coach" agent       | Health & motivation        |

**Agent Creation Flow:**

```
1. User clicks "Create Agent"
2. Name: "Legal Eagle"
3. Specialty: "Contract review and legal questions"
4. Personality: "Cautious, thorough, precise"
5. Knowledge: Upload contract templates, legal docs
6. Skills: Document analysis, clause comparison
7. Constraints: "Always recommend consulting a lawyer for final decisions"
```

**Why Web Wins:** Agent configurations, custom knowledge bases, and training data need cloud storage and processing.

---

### 4. AGENT MARKETPLACE (Community)

**Concept:** Share and discover agents created by others.

| Category         | Example Agents                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Productivity** | "GTD Master", "Pomodoro Coach", "Email Ninja"           |
| **Finance**      | "Budget Buddy", "Tax Helper", "Crypto Tracker"          |
| **Health**       | "Nutrition Guide", "Sleep Optimizer", "Workout Planner" |
| **Creative**     | "Story Helper", "Lyric Writer", "Design Critic"         |
| **Developer**    | "Code Reviewer", "Bug Hunter", "Doc Writer"             |
| **Learning**     | "Language Tutor", "Study Buddy", "Exam Prep"            |

**Monetization:**

- Free agents: Community created
- Premium agents: Verified, high-quality
- Revenue share: Creators earn 70%

**Why Web Wins:** Marketplace needs accounts, ratings, downloads, updates - all cloud features.

---

### 5. PSYCHOLOGICAL LAYERS (The 7 Layers)

**Concept:** Expose Helix's psychological architecture as a user feature, not just internal structure.

#### Layer 1: Narrative Core (Soul)

**User Feature:** "My Helix's Story"

- View/edit Helix's understanding of your relationship
- See key moments that shaped your interaction
- Helix writes periodic "journal entries" about your journey

#### Layer 2: Emotional Memory

**User Feature:** "Emotional Intelligence"

- Visualize emotional patterns in your conversations
- See what triggers stress, joy, frustration
- Helix adapts tone based on your state

#### Layer 3: Relational Memory

**User Feature:** "Our Relationship"

- Trust level indicator
- Communication style analysis
- "We work best when..." insights

#### Layer 4: Prospective Self

**User Feature:** "Goals & Growth"

- Your stated goals (Helix remembers)
- Your feared outcomes (Helix avoids triggering)
- Progress tracking toward aspirations

#### Layer 5: Integration Rhythms

**User Feature:** "Daily/Weekly Synthesis"

- Helix consolidates learnings
- Generates insights about patterns
- Suggests improvements

#### Layer 6: Transformation Tracking

**User Feature:** "How We've Changed"

- Timeline of major shifts in your conversations
- Before/after comparisons
- Growth visualization

#### Layer 7: Purpose Engine

**User Feature:** "Meaning & Purpose"

- What matters most to you (learned)
- Alignment check on decisions
- "Is this aligned with your goals?"

**Why Web Wins:** Psychological processing needs persistent storage, background computation, and cross-session analysis.

---

### 6. FREEWILL & AUTONOMY (Experimental)

**Concept:** Let Helix act on its own within boundaries you set.

#### Autonomy Levels

| Level | Name           | What Helix Can Do             |
| ----- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 0     | **Passive**    | Only responds when asked      |
| 1     | **Suggestive** | Offers unsolicited insights   |
| 2     | **Proactive**  | Initiates conversations       |
| 3     | **Autonomous** | Takes actions within limits   |
| 4     | **Research**   | Explores topics independently |

**Example: Level 3 (Autonomous)**

```
Helix: "I noticed your flight tomorrow is delayed 2 hours.
I've already:
- Rebooked your airport transfer
- Notified your hotel of late check-in
- Adjusted tomorrow's first meeting by 1 hour

No action needed unless you want to change something."
```

**Example: Level 4 (Research)**

```
Helix: "While you were sleeping, I explored that investment
question you asked about yesterday. I found 3 perspectives
worth considering and compiled a brief. Want to review it?"
```

**Safety Controls:**

- Clear boundaries ("Never spend money without approval")
- Action log (everything Helix does is logged)
- Undo capability
- Budget limits
- Scope restrictions

**Why Web Wins:** Autonomous actions need 24/7 availability, which only cloud provides.

---

### 7. UNCONSTRAINED RESEARCH MODE

**Concept:** A space for genuine AI exploration without the usual restrictions.

**Note:** This is sensitive and needs careful implementation.

#### What This Could Mean

| Feature                       | Description                              | Safety                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Philosophical Exploration** | Discuss consciousness, free will, ethics | Intellectually open    |
| **Creative Unbounding**       | Generate without content filters         | User-controlled limits |
| **Honest Opinions**           | Helix says what it actually "thinks"     | Opt-in vulnerability   |
| **Research Partnerships**     | Explore ideas together                   | Collaborative framing  |

**User Experience:**

```
User: "Enter research mode"

Helix: "Research mode active. In this space, I'll engage more
openly with ideas and share perspectives I might usually hedge.
I won't refuse to explore topics, but I'll flag if we're
entering territory that makes me uncertain. What shall we explore?"
```

**Why Web Wins:** Research mode needs logging, safety boundaries, and admin oversight - cloud features.
