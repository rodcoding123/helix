# Memory Synthesis User Guide

## Overview

Memory Synthesis analyzes your past conversations to detect patterns, identify themes, and provide personalized recommendations. Instead of manually reviewing hundreds of messages, the system automatically:

- **Detects patterns** - "You often mention deadlines" or "You frequently discuss team dynamics"
- **Identifies themes** - Your dominant emotions, goals, relationships
- **Provides insights** - "You tend to be more creative in the morning"
- **Offers recommendations** - "Consider scheduling important work before 10 AM"

This happens across **7 psychological layers**:

1. **Narrative Core** - Your life story and identity
2. **Emotional Memory** - Feelings, triggers, moods
3. **Relational Memory** - Relationships and attachments
4. **Prospective Self** - Goals, fears, future aspirations
5. **Integration Rhythms** - Patterns and cycles
6. **Transformation** - How you change and grow
7. **Purpose Engine** - Meaning and values
