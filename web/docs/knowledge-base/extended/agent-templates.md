## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Template

1. **Match your use case** - A "Code Reviewer" won't help with writing
2. **Check the rating** - 4+ stars usually means it's reliable
3. **Read recent reviews** - See what actual users say
4. **Preview before use** - Check the system prompt matches your needs
5. **Start with trending** - Trending templates are tested and popular

### Customizing Effectively

1. **Keep it simple** - Small customizations are better than rewrites
2. **Test changes** - Try one change at a time and test
3. **Preserve the core** - Don't remove the template's core purpose
4. **Document your changes** - Note what you modified and why
5. **Save variants** - Create different versions for different needs

### Examples

**Example 1: Code Review Agent**

Start with: "Code Reviewer" template
Customize:

- Change tone to "Friendly" (less intimidating)

**Example 2: Writing Assistant**

Start with: "Content Writer" template
Customize:

- Change formality to "Professional" for business writing

**Example 3: Tutor**
